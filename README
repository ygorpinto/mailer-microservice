## Mailer Microservise
#### This mailer was made in spring boot, using java 11, the idea is to have a microservice that can run in any type of application, easy to integrate and even easier to use.

#### In the future I will add integration with Apache Kafka

#### All you need to do is set these environment variables

#### SMTP_HOST= ${your smtp host} example smtp.gmail.com
#### SMTP_PORT= ${your smtp port} example 587
#### SMTP_USERNAME= ${your smtp user}
#### SMTP_PASSWORD= ${your smtp pass}

#### this project requires a postgres database, where it will store and make all email submissions auditable, there is already an image of postgres in the postgres folder
